Welcome to unamusings, my (roughly) fifteenth attempt at maintaining a technical blog. I've been building websites since the days of Angelfire and Geocities, but consistent content creation has always been my white whale. Well, as everyone knows, the 15th time is the charm.

I'll be sharing thoughts on machine learning, AI, and LLMs, along with glimpses into my other passionsâ€”volunteering with animals, kitchen experiments, homemade candy crafting, and travel adventures. Subscribe to the [RSS feed](https://hipml.github.io/feed.xml) if you'd like to stay updated!

This blog is running on [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) hosted by [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). I am using a modified version of the [no-style-please](https://github.com/riggraz/no-style-please) theme by [@riggraz](https://github.com/riggraz).
